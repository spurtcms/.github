## Hello, we are spurtCMS 👋

spurtCMS, an innovative Open Source Web Application crafted on the powerful Golang Technology. Developed with versatility in mind, it can serve as one-stop solution catering to a range of business needs across various industries.

spurtCMS Modules decoupled packages, allowing seamless integration into any existing Golang project. Whether you're looking to enhance an existing project or create a standalone application, spurtCMS offers you the flexibility. 

## Our Motive

Inspired by WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, we've devised a unified platform to address business needs. However, what sets us apart is our innovative approach for bringing versatility by leveraging the cutting-edge Golang Technology. Unlike conventional systems that cater to specific business requirements, we provide a highly adaptable solution that can cater to myriad business requirements for multiple purposes and ranges of applications.

## What makes us unique

Traditionally, content management systems have served specific needs such as blogging, ecommerce, Events , and booking systems.

However, we've taken a different approach. We've developed each functionality as a separate, decoupled package. These packages can be utilized individually for having that feature and workflow in your Golang web application or can also be used to construct entirely new ones. Our primary focus is on versatility – rather than being confined to one particular business need, our solution caters to a multitude of purposes, providing unparalleled flexibility and adaptability.
